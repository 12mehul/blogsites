They both come from a tribal family. The parents of these two children died of illness six years ago. One was eight years old, and the other was two. Both would live by cooking their own food and doing everything themselves. I saw their video and told CR Patil that something needed to be done. I was in Delhi at the time. But they were able to find a home. Computer, TV, and all amenities. Today, one said he wants to be a collector, and the other said he wants to be an engineer,\" PM Modi said.",
